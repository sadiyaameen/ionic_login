Login for facebook and google+


The pg1.html file gives us the first page. 
  This has two options: 
             Facebook  - In blue
             Google+   - In Red
  
  
  Then there are angularJS snippets for Facebook and Google+ login
  This allows us to view the user details such as profile photos, etc.
  
  Along with this there are also services for Facebook and Google+.
